# Twitch & YouTube Chat Voting
The voting app generates 4 random effects for your Twitch or YouTube live chat to choose from, the highest voted effect gets picked, or if proportional voting is enabled, each effect has a certain chance of being picked at random, eg. the more votes it has the higher the chance.
A voting panel will pop up that can be keyed out with a green screen using OBS. Users can type a number in chat that will add to the count in the effect list.

Open source, Instructions & Download to the [CS:GO Chaos Mod Voting Overlay](https://github.com/b0ink/csgo-chaos-mod-voting-overlay).

# REQUIREMENTS:
- [Sourcemod 1.11+](https://sourcemod.net/)
- [Dynamic Channels](https://github.com/Vauff/DynamicChannels) (Included in this repo)

# INSTALLATION:
- Copy the contents from `addons/sourcemod/` into your server's `csgo/addons/sourcemod/` folder.
- Copy the contents from `materials/` into your server's `csgo/materials/` folder.
- Copy the contents from `models/` into your server's `csgo/models/` folder.
- You may also need a [Fast DL](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=486331092) setup for other players to download the assets off your server. The `FastDL/` folder contains all the compressed assets to be placed on your Fast DL, otherwise all players will require to download the assets into their `csgo/` game directory.
- Restart your server/load the plugin.

If you encounter any errors please check your sourcemod error log files as well as the plugin's generated `chaos_logs.log` file found in `/addons/sourcemod/logs`, and double check that you have copied over all the files required for the plugin.

## Available Commands:
`sm_chaos`
- Displays a menu of Chaos options:
	- Enable/Disable Chaos | Start Timer
	- Spawn new effect from list
	- Settings
    	- Effects
    	- ConVars
  
`sm_effect <Effect Name | Search Term>`
- Brings up a menu of any effects containing the search term.

`sm_randomeffect`
- Instantly spawns a new effect, if allowed.

## Config
You can adjust the effect's duration and enable/disable it by using the "!chaos" command, and selecting `Settings -> Effects`.

ANY changes you make in-game will create a "Chaos_Override.cfg" file in "addons/sourcemod/configs/Chaos/", and automatically add/update your changes within the file. Anything in this file with be used instead of the plugin defaults (which in most cases is Enabled and 30 seconds duration).

Using this method means you can update Chaos to its latest version and corresponding config files without overwriting your changes.
More information about the Chaos config can be found here.


## Available ConVars:
`sm_chaos_enabled` | `Default. 1` | `Min. 0` | `Max. 1`
- Sets whether the Chaos plugin is enabled.\
Setting it to `1.0` will activate the interval timer and run an effect

`sm_chaos_prefix` | `Default. "[{lime}CHAOS{default}]"`
- Sets the Prefix of Chaos chat messages such as effect spawns (Multicolors supported).

`sm_chaos_interval` | `Default. 30` | `Min. 5` | `Max. 60`
- Sets how often (in seconds) a new effect will spawn

`sm_chaos_repeating` | `Default. 1` | `Min. 0` | `Max. 1`
- If set to `1.0`, random effects will continue to spawn at the rate of `sm_chaos_interval`.\
If set to `0.0`, only one effect will run at the start of the round.

`sm_chaos_override_duration` | `Default. -1` | `Min. -1` | `Max. 120`
- Override the duration (in seconds) of ALL effects.\
If set to `-1.0`, the plugin's default durations will be used.\
Set to `0.0` for infinite duration (Effect lasts the entire round).

`sm_chaos_voting_enabled` | `Default. 0` | `Min. 0` | `Max. 1`
- Sets whether the chaos plugin can communicate with the Twitch Overlay app to allow voting for effects.\
If set to `0`, effects will be spawned at random.\
If set to `1`, 3 random effects will be displayed in the Twitch Overlay app and will spawn the most voted effect. (1 of the 3 effects will be spawned if there are no votes). 

`sm_chaos_effect_timer_color` | `Default. "220 0 220 0"`
- Set the RGBA values of the Effect Timer countdown. (Default is purple)

`sm_chaos_effect_list_color` | `Default. "37 186 255 0"`
- Set the RGBA values of the Effect List on the side. (Default is blue)

`sm_chaos_effect_timer_position` | `Default. "-1 0.06"`
- Sets the xy position of the effect timer. Ranges from 0 and 1. -1 is center.

`sm_chaos_effect_list_position` | `Default. "0.01 0.42"`
- Sets the xy position of the effect list. Ranges from 0 and 1. -1 is center.

Chaos ConVars are controlled through `sourcemod/configs/Chaos/Chaos_Convars.cfg`, or alternatively through the `!chaos->Settings` menu, which will automatically update the ConVar config.


## Spawn Points
Several effects rely on map-specific spawn points to spawn items and teleport players, here are a list of maps that currently have spawn points saved for and defined in [Chaos_Locations.cfg](addons/sourcemod/data/Chaos_Locations.cfg). **However,** if a map does not currently have any spawn points, the Chaos plugin will automatically [save markers](addons/sourcemod/scripting/Configs.sp#L176-L212) based on player positions as they move around the map. Most effects that depend on spawn points require a minimum set amount of spawns, and will automatically activate once enough spawn points are generated. This means the Chaos plugin should work on any custom maps.
- Dust 2
- Mirage
- Inferno
- Nuke
- Vertigo
- Ancient
- Overpass

### Known issues:
- Certain resolutions (mostly widescreens, and in my case 2560x1080) cut off the HUD overlay on the right side of the screen, this means the announcement texts and bar timer might not look correct, lowering your resolution should fix this.
	- It is also recommended to **restart** CS:GO after adjusting your resolution, otherwise the HUD may appear much larger than it should be.
	- 4k resolutions by default have an extremely enlarged HUD that makes the game unplayable, setting it to 1080p and restarting your game should fix this.
	- An alternative method is to set `-w 1920 -h 1080` in your CS:GO's launch options.
